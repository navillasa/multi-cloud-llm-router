A comprehensive overview of building a cost-optimized, intelligent LLM router that automatically distributes requests across AWS, GCP, and Azure. Covers the motivation, technical architecture, and lessons learned from going from a simple self-hosted LLM to a production-ready multi-cloud system.

**Topics covered:**
- Multi-cloud Kubernetes deployment
- Cost-aware routing algorithms
- GitOps with ArgoCD
- Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi and Go
- CPU-optimized LLM serving
- Production monitoring and observability

## Future Posts
