# Building a Multi-Cloud LLM Router: A Journey from Hetzner to Global Scale

*Published: August 24, 2025*

## Introduction

After successfully running a self-hosted mini LLM (gpt4all-j) on Hetzner, I found myself hungry for a bigger challenge. I wanted to combine several of my interests and learning goals into one ambitious project: running Kubernetes across all three major cloud providers, gaining more hands-on experience with ArgoCD, diving deeper into LLM hosting, and finally getting to work with Pulumi and Go (my absolute favorite programming language).

What started as a learning exercise is evolving into an ambitious multi-cloud LLM router that will automatically distribute requests to the cheapest available cluster across AWS, GCP, and Azure. Currently, I have the router working locally and the AWS infrastructure fully provisioned, with the remaining cloud deployments and full multi-cloud integration as the next major milestone.

## The Problem: LLM Cost Optimization at Scale

Large Language Models are expensive to run. Whether you're using OpenAI's API, hosting your own models, or running inference at scale, costs can quickly spiral out of control. The traditional approach involves either:

1. **Single cloud provider** - Risk of vendor lock-in and missing cost optimizations
2. **Manual switching** - Time-consuming and error-prone
3. **Static routing** - Doesn't adapt to real-time price changes or performance

I wanted to build something that could:
- **Automatically route to the cheapest healthy cluster** in real-time
- **Run across multiple clouds** for redundancy and cost optimization
- **Scale to zero** during low usage periods
- **Use CPU-only inference** with quantized models for maximum cost efficiency
- **Provide observability** for cost tracking and performance monitoring

## The Solution: An Intelligent Multi-Cloud Router

The architecture I built follows this pattern:

```

## Technology Choices and Learning Goals

### Why Go?
Go has become my favorite programming language for several reasons:
- **Excellent concurrency** - Perfect for a router handling many simultaneous requests
- **Static typing** - Catches errors at compile time
- **Fast compilation** - Quick iteration during development
- **Great ecosystem** - Fantastic libraries for HTTP, metrics, and cloud APIs
- **Simple deployment** - Single binary with no dependencies

### Why Pulumi?
Coming from Terraform, I was excited to try Pulumi because:
- **Real programming language** - Can use Go instead of HCL
- **Type safety** - IDE support and compile-time checking
- **Familiar patterns** - Can use existing Go knowledge and libraries
- **Better testing** - Unit tests with real Go testing frameworks

### Why ArgoCD?
My previous experience with ArgoCD was limited, so this project was perfect for:
- **GitOps best practices** - Declarative infrastructure management
- **Multi-cluster management** - Single pane of glass for all environments

## The Magic: Cost-Aware Routing

The core innovation is the real-time cost calculation that considers:

```go
costPer1K = (nodeHourlyCost / (tokensPerSecond * 3600)) * overheadFactor * 1000
```

**Example with real numbers:**
- **AWS t3.small SPOT**: $0.0093/hour, 8 TPS → $0.0003/1K tokens (90% savings!)
- **GCP n1-standard-1**: $0.0475/hour, 6 TPS → $0.0022/1K tokens  
- **Azure Standard_B2s**: $0.0416/hour, 7 TPS → $0.0016/1K tokens

The router automatically selects AWS SPOT in this scenario, potentially saving 85-90% on inference costs compared to on-demand pricing.

## Performance and Cost Expectations

Based on the architecture and testing:

**TinyLlama 1.1B on t3.small SPOT instances:**
- **Throughput**: ~8 tokens/second (sufficient for development/testing)
- **Cost**: ~$0.0003 per 1K tokens (90% savings vs on-demand!)
- **Latency**: <2 seconds for short prompts
- **Availability**: 99.9%+ with multi-cloud redundancy
- **Monthly cost**: ~$15-20/month for always-on development cluster

**Scale-to-zero benefits:**
- Pods scale down to 0 during low usage
- Models cached in PVC (no re-download cost)
- Clusters can auto-scale nodes to minimum

## The Cost Optimization Journey

One of the most valuable aspects of this project was learning how small configuration changes can dramatically impact costs:

### Original Configuration (Expensive!)
- **Instance Type**: t3.large (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
- **Pricing Model**: On-demand
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$70 per cluster × 3 clouds = **$210/month**
- **Reason**: "Production-grade" thinking without cost analysis

### Optimized Configuration (Learning-Friendly!)
- **Instance Type**: t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) 
- **Pricing Model**: SPOT instances
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$7 per cluster × 3 clouds = **$21/month**
- **Savings**: **90% reduction** while maintaining functionality

### Key Optimizations Made
1. **Right-sized for workload** - TinyLlama needs ~1.5GB RAM, so t3.small is perfect
2. **SPOT instances** - 90% cheaper, with auto-restart handling
3. **Regional optimization** - us-east-1 has better AZ coverage
4. **Environment naming** - Proper "dev" environment prevents production confusion
5. **Individual Pulumi account** - Avoided trial limitations

This cost optimization exercise taught me that **"production-ready" doesn't mean "expensive"** - it means understanding your workload requirements and choosing the right tools for the job.

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Go is fantastic for infrastructure tools** - The concurrency model and standard library made building the router straightforward
2. **Pulumi's type safety is a game-changer** - Catching configuration errors at compile time saved hours of debugging
3. **ArgoCD scales beautifully** - The app-of-apps pattern makes managing multiple clusters intuitive
4. **CPU inference with SPOT instances is incredibly cost-effective** - 90% savings while maintaining acceptable performance
5. **Cost optimization requires careful configuration** - Small changes (t3.large→t3.small, on-demand→SPOT) dramatically impact economics

### Project Management
1. **Incremental commits tell a story** - Breaking the work into logical chunks made the project much more maintainable
2. **Documentation is crucial** - Writing comprehensive guides helped clarify the architecture
3. **Setup automation is worth the investment** - The interactive scripts make the project accessible to new contributors
4. **Cost analysis upfront prevents surprises** - Understanding pricing models early avoided expensive mistakes

### Cost Optimization Journey
1. **Initial setup was expensive** - t3.large on-demand would cost ~$70/month per cluster
2. **SPOT instances provide massive savings** - 90% reduction in compute costs
3. **Right-sizing matters** - t3.small provides adequate performance for learning/development
4. **Region selection affects availability** - us-east-1 has better AZ coverage than us-west-2

## Next Steps

The foundation is solid and cost-optimized. The immediate priority is completing the AWS deployment and expanding to other clouds:

1. **Deploy to AWS** - Complete the EKS deployment with cost-optimized t3.small SPOT instances
2. **Validate cost routing locally** - Test the cost calculation engine with real cluster metrics
3. **Add GCP and Azure clusters** - Deploy the patterns to complete the multi-cloud setup
4. **Implement production models** (Phi-3 Mini, TinyLlama) for real workloads
5. **Add circuit breaker patterns** for improved reliability in SPOT instance environment
6. **Build cost dashboards** in Grafana for financial monitoring and SPOT instance tracking
7. **Implement auto-scaling** policies that work well with SPOT instance interruptions

## From Learning Project to Production System

What started as a way to learn new technologies is becoming a production-ready system that could save significant money for organizations running LLM workloads at scale. The combination of Go's performance, Pulumi's type safety, ArgoCD's GitOps capabilities, and multi-cloud redundancy creates a powerful platform for cost-optimized AI inference.

The project demonstrates that with the right architecture and tooling, you can build sophisticated infrastructure that's both cost-effective and highly available. While still in active development, the foundation is solid and the local testing validates the core concepts.

This has been an incredible journey from a simple self-hosted LLM on Hetzner to a (soon-to-be) global, multi-cloud AI infrastructure platform. The next chapter involves completing the cloud deployment and scaling to production workloads.
