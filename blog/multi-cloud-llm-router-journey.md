# Building a Multi-Cloud LLM Router: A Journey from Hetzner to Global Scale

*Published: August 24, 2025*

## Introduction

After successfully running a self-hosted mini LLM (gpt4all-j) on Hetzner, I found myself hungry for a bigger challenge. I wanted to combine several of my interests and learning goals into one ambitious project: running Kubernetes across all three major cloud providers, gaining more hands-on experience with ArgoCD, diving deeper into LLM hosting, and finally getting to work with Pulumi and Go (my absolute favorite programming language).

What started as a learning exercise became a production-ready, cost-optimized multi-cloud LLM router that automatically distributes requests to the cheapest available cluster across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## The Problem: LLM Cost Optimization at Scale

Large Language Models are expensive to run. Whether you're using OpenAI's API, hosting your own models, or running inference at scale, costs can quickly spiral out of control. The traditional approach involves either:

1. **Single cloud provider** - Risk of vendor lock-in and missing cost optimizations
2. **Manual switching** - Time-consuming and error-prone
3. **Static routing** - Doesn't adapt to real-time price changes or performance

I wanted to build something that could:
- **Automatically route to the cheapest healthy cluster** in real-time
- **Run across multiple clouds** for redundancy and cost optimization
- **Scale to zero** during low usage periods
- **Use CPU-only inference** with quantized models for maximum cost efficiency
- **Provide observability** for cost tracking and performance monitoring

## The Solution: An Intelligent Multi-Cloud Router

The architecture I built follows this pattern:

```

          ┌──────────────┼────────────────┐

                         ↓
                 [Router cost engine]
```

### Key Components

**1. Intelligent Router (Go)**
- Real-time cost calculation: `(node_hourly_cost / (tokens_per_sec * 3600)) * overhead_factor * 1000`
- Health monitoring with SLA enforcement (latency, queue depth)
- HMAC and mTLS authentication
- Prometheus metrics for observability
- Sticky routing to prevent flapping

**2. Multi-Cloud Infrastructure (Pulumi)**
- AWS EKS with optimized node groups (t3.large for cost efficiency)
- Ready-to-deploy GCP GKE and Azure AKS configurations
- Consistent networking, security, and naming across clouds
- Automated DNS and TLS certificate management

**3. GitOps Deployment (ArgoCD)**
- App-of-apps pattern for managing multiple clusters
- Automated deployments with self-healing
- Environment-specific configurations via Kustomize
- Platform components: ingress-nginx, cert-manager, prometheus

**4. CPU-Optimized LLM Serving**
- llama.cpp with quantized GGUF models
- Model caching via PVC (download once per node)
- Auto-scaling with scale-to-zero capabilities
- Comprehensive metrics collection

## Technology Choices and Learning Goals

### Why Go?
Go has become my favorite programming language for several reasons:
- **Excellent concurrency** - Perfect for a router handling many simultaneous requests
- **Static typing** - Catches errors at compile time
- **Fast compilation** - Quick iteration during development
- **Great ecosystem** - Fantastic libraries for HTTP, metrics, and cloud APIs
- **Simple deployment** - Single binary with no dependencies

### Why Pulumi?
Coming from Terraform, I was excited to try Pulumi because:
- **Real programming language** - Can use Go instead of HCL
- **Type safety** - IDE support and compile-time checking
- **Familiar patterns** - Can use existing Go knowledge and libraries
- **Better testing** - Unit tests with real Go testing frameworks

### Why ArgoCD?
My previous experience with ArgoCD was limited, so this project was perfect for:
- **GitOps best practices** - Declarative infrastructure management
- **Multi-cluster management** - Single pane of glass for all environments
- **Application lifecycle** - Automated deployments and rollbacks
- **Security** - RBAC and audit trails built-in

## What I Built

### 1. Project Foundation
Started with proper Go module structure and comprehensive documentation:
- Multi-cloud architecture overview
- Cost calculation methodology
- Development and deployment guides

### 2. Infrastructure Common Utilities
Built reusable components for consistent cloud deployments:
- Resource naming conventions
- Kubeconfig generation for all three cloud providers
- Standardized tagging and labeling

### 3. AWS Infrastructure (Complete)
Implemented full EKS deployment with:
- VPC and networking optimized for cost
- Node groups using t3.large instances
- IAM roles and security policies
- Automated ArgoCD installation

### 4. Intelligent Router Core
The heart of the system with advanced features:
- **Cost calculation engine** - Real-time $/1K token calculations
- **Health monitoring** - SLA enforcement and circuit breaker patterns
- **Request forwarding** - Streaming support with authentication
- **Observability** - Comprehensive Prometheus metrics

### 5. Production Helm Charts
Professional-grade Kubernetes deployments:
- **llm-server chart** - llama.cpp with model caching and auto-scaling
- **platform chart** - Core infrastructure (ingress, monitoring, certificates)
- **Cloud-specific values** - Optimized for each provider's services

### 6. GitOps Configuration
Complete ArgoCD setup with:
- App-of-apps pattern for scalability
- Environment-specific overlays
- Automated sync policies with self-healing

### 7. Model Registry and CI/CD

- Multiple deployment options (local, cloud, development)

### 9. Setup Automation
One-command deployment with multiple options:
- Local demo for testing
- Full AWS deployment
- Development environment setup

## The Magic: Cost-Aware Routing

The core innovation is the real-time cost calculation that considers:

```go
costPer1K = (nodeHourlyCost / (tokensPerSecond * 3600)) * overheadFactor * 1000
```

**Example with real numbers:**
- **AWS t3.large**: $0.0928/hour, 15 TPS → $0.0017/1K tokens
- **GCP n1-standard-2**: $0.0950/hour, 12 TPS → $0.0022/1K tokens  
- **Azure Standard_D2s_v3**: $0.0968/hour, 14 TPS → $0.0019/1K tokens

The router automatically selects AWS in this scenario, potentially saving 10-20% on inference costs.

2. **Pulumi's type safety is a game-changer** - Catching configuration errors at compile time saved hours of debugging
3. **ArgoCD scales beautifully** - The app-of-apps pattern makes managing multiple clusters intuitive
4. **CPU inference is cost-effective** - Quantized models on CPU can provide excellent price/performance

### Project Management

3. **Implement circuit breaker patterns** for improved reliability
4. **Add request queueing** for handling traffic spikes
5. **Build cost dashboards** in Grafana for financial monitoring
6. **Implement A/B testing** capabilities for model experimentation

## From Learning Project to Production System

What started as a way to learn new technologies became a production-ready system that could save significant money for organizations running LLM workloads at scale. The combination of Go's performance, Pulumi's type safety, ArgoCD's GitOps capabilities, and multi-cloud redundancy creates a powerful platform for cost-optimized AI inference.

The project demonstrates that with the right architecture and tooling, you can build sophisticated infrastructure that's both cost-effective and highly available. Most importantly, it shows how learning projects can evolve into real-world solutions when you combine multiple interests and technologies thoughtfully.

This has been an incredible journey from a simple self-hosted LLM on Hetzner to a global, multi-cloud AI infrastructure platform. The next chapter involves scaling to production workloads and continuing to optimize for cost and performance.
